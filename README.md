## Project Summary

## Setup Instructions
**Create an AWS Sagemaker On-Demand Notebook Instance**  
The recommended instance size is at lease ml.t3.large to try out the code. If you would like to train your own version of the model, a GPU-enabled instance like a ml.p3.8xlarge is required. The satellite image dataset is very large, so the volume size of the instance should be at lest 60GB.
