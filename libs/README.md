# External Python Libraries
README from [Deep Learning on AWS Open Data Registry: Automatic Building and Road Extraction from Satellite and LiDAR](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-open-data-satellite-lidar-tutorial) and not edited by project team.

This directory includes external Python libraries after some customization. Other dependencies without customization should be set up by `setup-env.sh` via `conda` and `pip`.

- `solaris`: An open source ML pipeline for overhead imagery. [Link to GitHub repo](https://github.com/CosmiQ/solaris)
- `apls`: APLS (Average Path Length Similarity), a toolkit to extract road graph network from prediction masks and compute the metric scores against ground truth. [Link to GitHub repo](https://github.com/CosmiQ/apls)
